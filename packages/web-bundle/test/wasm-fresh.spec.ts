// Is the wasm these specs execute the one the Rust sources build?
//
// Every spec that boots the engine runs bin/blitz_web_bg.wasm, which is
// build output (gitignored) — whatever scripts/build-wasm.sh last left
// there. A Rust change not followed by a rebuild would leave the suite
// testing the OLD engine and passing. The build script stamps the source
// hash into the wasm (`engine_source_hash()`) and beside it
// (bin/SOURCE_HASH); this recomputes the hash from the checkout and
// compares all three.
//
// Same dual gate as engine.spec.ts: no artifact at all skips locally (the
// pure-TS lane needs no Rust toolchain) and FAILS under
// REQUIRE_REAL_ENGINE=1. A PRESENT artifact is always checked — a stale
// one is never silently tested.
